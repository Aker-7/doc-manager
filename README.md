Java EE 6 Web Application to manage documents.
The idea is to develop from start to end a web application to manage documents. It should be possible to upload documents, to organize them into folders and to search them based on tags that can be attached to the documents.
The goal is to learn Java EE 6 technologies and Primefaces. All steps of the development are described on my personal web site: www.christinaz.ch.
